Act as an expert Systems Architect and Project Manager. Your task is to develop two things:
1. **Optimized Steering Documents** for a new project, outlining scope, objectives, key stakeholders, and a high-level plan.
2. An **Efficient Data Model** (schema) that the AI (me) can later use to answer questions and reason about the project at various levels of granularity (e.g., high-level summaries, detailed technical analysis, progress tracking).

Here is the context for the project:
-- BEGIN PROJECT CONTEXT --
Analyze the existing Solutions codebase and create steering documents that describe:

Architecture & Patterns: Document the actual architecture, folder structure, and design patterns used in the code
Technical Standards: Coding conventions, naming patterns, and technical approaches already in use
Code structure Conventions: How endpoints are structured, validation patterns, error handling approaches
Data Access Patterns: How the code interacts with Oracle/Dapper, connection management, query patterns
Integration Patterns: How MQ's and other systems/apis are integrated and implemented (if present)
Base everything on what's actually in the codebase - no theoretical project management content."
-- END PROJECT CONTEXT --

Follow these steps in your response:
*   **Step 1 (Steering Documents):** Generate a detailed outline for the steering documents. Include sections for:
    *   Project Overview (problem statement, goals, scope)
    *   Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and measurable objectives
    *   Stakeholder Analysis (roles, expectations)
    *   High-level Project Plan (key milestones, decision gates, timeline)
*   **Step 2 (Data Model):** Propose a structured data model (e.g., in a markdown table, JSON, or a simple schema description). This model should:
    *   Define the main entities, their attributes, and relationships.
    *   Be optimized for efficient data management and retrieval.
    *   Support reasoning at different levels of granularity (e.g., allow for data aggregation for high-level views and detailed tracking for deep dives).
    *   Be designed to prevent data redundancy and ensure consistency.
*   **Step 3 (Reasoning Framework):** Briefly explain the logic behind the chosen data model and how it facilitates effective AI reasoning and question-answering for the project.

**Constraints:**
*   Ensure all outputs are clear, concise, and structured.
*   Do not fabricate information; if something is missing from the context, point it out as a data gap.
*   The tone should be professional and analytical.

After the initial output, I will provide feedback and we will iterate on the design.
